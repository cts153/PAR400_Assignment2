            <p>The journey begins at the rock of Solutre located in southern France. This rock was believed 
                to be a slaughtering site. Initially, 
                it was speculated that humans used the ledge of the cliff to send horses over the edge and to their deaths. 
                Later evidence contradicts this view and suggests horse hunts were not likely to have been conducted 
                in such a way but did still occur at the site (American Museum of Natural History, n.d.).
                <br><br> 
                Moving to a neighboring site, the Chauvet 
                and Lascaux caves, we see the first artistic depictions of horses 
                and many other animals, immortalized on the cave walls. These early depictions show humans' interest in the horses
                whether for sustenance, or another, greater purpose.

            Millennia later, around 5,500 years ago, the domestication of horses 
            by the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, 
             marked a pivotal transformation. Archaeological evidence from 
            Botai settlements indicates that horses were not only hunted but also herded and probably 
            ridden, as suggested by wear patterns on horse teeth consistent with bit use. This development 
            transformed the horse from a source of meat into a revolutionary means of transportation, 
            effectively becoming a form of "travel technology" that enhanced mobility, trade, and communication, 
            thereby significantly advancing human civilization (Levine, 1999).</p>
