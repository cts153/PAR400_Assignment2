        <h4>Job 39:19-25 KJV<h4><br><br>
        <p>
            Outside of Greek mythology, the presence of the horse 
            can be observed in all major religions, as well as in 
            lesser-known spiritual traditions. In the passage above, 
            taken from the Bible, the horse is portrayed as a symbol 
            of power and freedom. Later, in Revelation, horses serve 
            alongside the messengers of the apocalypse, often 
            referred to as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In 
            this same text, Christ is depicted riding a white horse.
            The white horse is consistently set apart, symbolizing purity, 
            innocence, and divine righteousness.

        <p>In Hindu tradition, the horse-headed deity Hayagriva (pictured above)
            is regarded to be the god of wisdom and triumph of Knowledge. 
            He is often called on when studying sacred and secular subjects. 
            In Norse mythology, Odin's eight-legged horse, Sleipnir, 
            is believed to transcend realms, acting as a bridge between 
            the mortal and the divine. Similarly, in Celtic tradition, 
            the goddess Epona presides over the equestrian realm, revered 
            as a protector of horses and their riders (Long Riders Guild 
            Academic Foundation, n.d.). These depictions across various 
            spiritual traditions reveal a universal reverence for the 
            horse—not only as a symbol of power and nobility, but as a 
            sacred and loyal companion, aiding humanity through life's 
            most profound journeys.</p>
