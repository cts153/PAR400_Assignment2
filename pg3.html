            (February 17, 2018 - July 8, 2018)</p>
            <p>While the Botai culture is the first recorded instance of domestication for 
                practical use, ancient Greek warriors can be credited with the development 
                of the first philosophies of horsemanship. Circa 350 B.C. a Corinthian military leader
                 and student of Socrates, named Xenophon, wrote the oldest known treatise 
                “On Horsemanship.” The treatise gives its readers details about how to 
                evaluate a horse for purchase and the correct methods to train such a horse. 
                Xenophon also emphasized the importance of understanding the horse's nature 
                and advocated for gentle, systematic training rather than force or 
                cruelty.</p><br><br> 
                
                <p class="quote">“What a horse does under compulsion, he does blindly, 
                and his performance is no more beautiful than would be that of a ballet-dancer 
                taught by whip and goad…What we need is that  the horse should of his own 
                accord exhibit his finest airs and paces at set signals…The majesty of men 
                themselves is best discovered in the graceful handling of such animals.” 
                -Xenophon, On Horsemanship, p.50</p><br><br><br>
            
                
            <p>Horses also occupied a sacred place in Greek culture, originating in the mythology 
            of Poseidon and giving rise to other heroes. According to the myth of Poseidon, 
            god of the sea and 
            creator of the horse, pegasus was born from the head of Medusa after she was slain. 
            The taming of Pegasus is later attributed to Bellerophon (Tufts University, n.d.). 
            This link between Poseidon and the horse adds 
            a deeper, sacred, layer of reverence to the human-horse relationship in 
            Greek culture. We will see this sacred aspect perpetuated in 
            later religious traditions as well. </p>

            <p>Above: This large medallion is the central part 
                of a Roman floor mosaic discovered in an Autun aristocratic residence in 1830. 
                The medallion depicts the myth of Bellerophon riding Pegasus and 
                slaying the chimera, 
                a monster with the body of a lion, a goat, and a snake, on a black background. 
                The hero is about to plunge his spear into the animal's throat. This theme 
                evokes the victory of intelligence and bravery over evil, and Bellerophon 
                is the Greek model of an ancient hero. The same posture is later repeated in the 
                Christian era in the iconography of Saint George (Musée Rolin).</p>
