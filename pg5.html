        <p>Any genuine horseman who takes pride in their partnership will tell 
            you why the endeavor is valuable and beneficial for both parties. 
            They will speak of the myriad of ways in which horses contributes 
            to their physical, mental, and even spiritual well-being. Yet there is another 
            growing body thought that would seek to abolish horse use entirely or at least enforce 
            extreme restrictions. From a utilitarian perspective horses are no 
            longer a necessity for transportation, 
            agriculture, or warfare and therefore we should return them to the wild and 
            abstain from all involvement. Cases such as collapsing carriage 
            horses in the streets are often cited as the justification for ending the 
            practices of horse use altogether. This tension raises a fundamental question: 
            What does ethical horsemanship look like in the modern world? 
            To answer this, we can turn to psychology, philosophy, and tradition. 
            <br><br>

            Horses, unlike typical livestock, have functioned as a form of technology, 
            enhancing human capabilities. 
            Even today, horses serve as invaluable partners in search-and-rescue, 
            therapy, law enforcement, and sport. Their role continues to evolve 
            alongside human progress, proving that they are not obsolete relics 
            of the past, but an ever-adapting extension of human ingenuity.
            <br><br>
            Our treatment of horses reflects our moral character. 
            Ethical horsemanship must be about cultivating a relationship 
            based on mutual respect through effective communication. 
            When done correctly, practice is a manifestation of our virtues - 
            which should be developed with utmost care. 
            <br><br>
            From a spiritual perspective, theists may recognize the 
            human-horse relationship as a fractal of divinity. 
            Just as a loving God does not force humans into obedience 
            but rather invites them into a relationship of trust and growth, 
            a good horseman does not dominate the horse's spirit by force, 
            but communicates with patience and wisdom. Through this lens, 
            horsemanship is not just a technical skill, it is a spiritual 
            discipline through which we may experience humility, presence, 
            and harmony with divine order.
