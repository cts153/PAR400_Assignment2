    <p>For thousands of years, humans and horses have shared a unique 
      journey through war and peace, labor and leisure, ritual and revelation. 
      Beyond being mere companions or tools for survival, horses have played a 
      profound role in shaping human civilization. The ethical and emotional dimensions 
      of our historically-symbiotic relationship raises important questions about the 
      preservation of this mutual flourishing as human civilization continues to progess.<br><br> 
      This project is a visual exploration of that relationship, presented as a 
      gallery of curated media beginning with the 
      historical and evolutionary context and ending with my personal collection 
      of photography. 
      Each gallery will highlight key moments in the history of our 
      relationship with horses. Accompanying these images are reflections that delve 
      deeper into the topic, exploring the human-horse relationship through the lenses 
      of philosophy, religion, and psychology. It is my hope that the media in these 
      galleries will inspire viewers to reflect on the wisdom of the horse and how it might have
      contributed to their own flourishing.
